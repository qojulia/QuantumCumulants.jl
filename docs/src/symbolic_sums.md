# Symbolic Sums and Indices

Many physical systems contain multiple elements of the same kind, which basically do the same thing just with different rates. For these systems it is convenient to describe the Hamiltonian and the dissipative processes with indexed objects and sums. A well-known example is the Tavis-Cummings Hamiltonian, which describes the interaction of $N$ two-level atoms with a cavity mode according to the Hamiltonian

```math
\begin{equation}
H_\mathrm{TC} = \omega_c a^† a + \sum_i^N \omega_i \sigma_i^{22} + \sum_i^N g_i (a^\dagger \sigma_i^{12} + a \sigma_i^{21}).
\end{equation}
```

In principle we can write down and derive the equations for all $N$ atoms explicitly, but this can take a long time for large $N$. The more practical and elegant approach is to derive the equations for averages of indexed operators and insert all possible number combinations afterwards. The implementation of symbolic sums and indices allows for exactly this.

## Implementation

### Index

The main tool to use symbolic summations is the **Index** object. This object has four different fields, which all need to be specified upon construction. These fields consist of the full [`HilbertSpace`](@ref) **h**, a **name**, which is just a generic symbol, a **range**, which can either consist of again a symbol or a concrete number, and a specific Hilbert space **aon**, which defines the space on which operators, that inherit the **Index** entity, act on. This means that an **Index** for a [`NLevelSpace`](@ref) can only be used by [`Transition`](@ref) operators. In the example below, two indices are defined equivalently, as well as a third one being defined acting on the [`FockSpace`](@ref) of the defined [`ProductSpace`](@ref) **h**.


```@example symbolic_sums
using QuantumCumulants

@cnumbers N

ha = NLevelSpace(:atoms,2)
hc = FockSpace(:cavity)
h = hc ⊗ ha

i = Index(h,:i,N,ha)
i2 = Index(h,:i,N,2) #equivalent definition

n = Index(h,:n,5,hc)
```


### IndexedOperators

Operators, such as [`Destroy`](@ref) or [`Transition`](@ref) can be associated with an [`Index`](@ref) of the corresponding Hilbert space by creating a so-called [`IndexedOperator`](@ref). This object consists of two fields, namely the operator itself and an **Index**. Below, there are two **IndexedOperator** entities created on the two different Hilbert spaces defined previously.


```@example symbolic_sums
σ(x,y,z) = IndexedOperator(Transition(h,:σ,x,y),z)
a(z) = IndexedOperator(Destroy(h,:a),z)
```


In the above example, we defined both indexed operators **σ** and **a** as callable instances with the attribute-variable **z**. These can now be used to easily create operators, that act specifically with their associated index.


```@example symbolic_sums
a(n)*σ(2,2,i)
nothing #hide
```

```math
{a}_{n} {\sigma}_{i}^{{22}}
```

Similar to operators, one can also create so-called [`IndexedVariable`](@ref) objects, which consist simply of a name and an index.


```@example symbolic_sums
gi = IndexedVariable(:g,i)
nothing #hide
```

```math
{g}_{i}
```

### Summations

As for now, we only created single instances of indexed operators. These operators and variables can now be used to define symbolic summations, which can then again be used in defining a Hamiltonian and deriving equations of motion for specific operator averages. Such a summation needs two arguments to be constructed, the **term**, over which the summation shall sum over, and an [`Index`](@ref), over which the sum runs. As an example, we define below a simple sum over a single indexed operator.

```@example symbolic_sums
∑(σ(2,2,i),i)
nothing #hide
```

```math
\underset{i}{\overset{N}{\sum}} {σ}_{i}^{{22}}
```

As can be seen above, a sum with a single running-index can be created using the **∑** (\sum) command. Other equivalent functions are **Σ** (\Pauli) and the **SingleSum()** constructor. These constructors can also take a third optional argument specifying a set of indices, which are non equivalent to the summation index.


```@example symbolic_sums
j = Index(h,:j,N,2)
∑(σ(2,2,i),i,[j])
nothing #hide
```

```math
\underset{i ≠j }{\overset{N}{\sum}} {σ}_{i}^{{22}}
```

Similar to this one can also create summations over up to two different running-indices:

```@example symbolic_sums
∑(a(n)*σ(2,1,i),i,n)
nothing #hide
```

```math
\underset{i}{\overset{N}{\sum}} \underset{n}{\overset{5}{\sum}} {a}_{n}  {σ}_{i}^{{21}}
```


These two running-indices do not need to act on different Hilbert spaces. In particular, for indices acting on the same Hilbert space, a simplification occurs, as shown below.


```@example symbolic_sums
k = Index(h,:k,N,ha)
l = Index(h,:l,N,ha)

∑(σ(2,1,k)*σ(1,2,l),k,l)
nothing #hide
```

```math
\underset{k{\ne}l}{\overset{N}{\sum}} \underset{l{\ne}k}{\overset{N}{\sum}} {\sigma}_{l}^{{12}}  {\sigma}_{k}^{{21}} + \underset{k}{\overset{N}{\sum}} {\sigma}_{k}^{{22}}
```


If two indices, acting on the same Hilbert space, meet inside of a sum, the special case, where the numeric values of both indices are the same, i.e `l`=`k`, is calculated immediately. This can also be observed, when a symbolic sum is multiplied with an [`IndexedOperator`](@ref) that is acting on the same Hilbert space as the summation-index.


```@example symbolic_sums
∑(σ(2,2,k),k) * σ(2,1,l)
nothing #hide
```

```math
\underset{k{\ne}l}{\overset{N}{\sum}} {\sigma}_{k}^{{22}}  {\sigma}_{l}^{{21}} + {\sigma}_{l}^{{21}}
```

## Short Example

We will briefly go over the entire process of defining a Hamiltonian, the derivation of equations and solving these equations numerically. For this example we will consider **N** 2-level atoms in a single mode cavity.

We start by defining all indices and operators and create the Hamiltonian.


```@example symbolic_sums
using QuantumCumulants

ha = NLevelSpace(:atoms,2)
hc = FockSpace(:cavity)
h = hc ⊗ ha

@cnumbers N Δ κ γ ν

i = Index(h,:i,N,ha)
j = Index(h,:j,N,ha)

@qnumbers b::Destroy(h)
σ(x,y,z) = IndexedOperator(Transition(h,:σ,x,y),z)
gi = IndexedVariable(:g,i)

H = Δ*b'*b + ∑(gi*(b*σ(2,1,i) + b'*σ(1,2,i)),i)
nothing #hide
```

```math
\underset{i}{\overset{N}{\sum}} {g}_{i}  b  {\sigma}_{i}^{{21}} + \underset{i}{\overset{N}{\sum}} {g}_{i}  b^\dagger  {\sigma}_{i}^{{12}} + \Delta b^\dagger b
```

We continue by defining the starting operators **ops**, for which the equations are derived, as well as the Jump operators **J** with their corresponding rates. It is important to note here, that the indexed operators, for which these equations are derived need to have an [`Index`](@ref), which is not yet used in the Hamiltonian, jumps or rates. We can then create the first set by simply calling the **meanfield** function.
Note, if an indexed operator $J_i$ is used as jump operator, the following dissipative term is created

```math
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{2} \sum_{j} R_{i} \bigg( 2 J_i^\dagger \mathcal{O} J_i - \mathcal{O} J_i^\dagger J_i -  J_i^\dagger J_i \mathcal{O} \bigg).
\end{equation}
```

The corresponding rate can, but does need to be an indexed variable. However, if it is, then the index of variable needs to match with the operator.


```@example symbolic_sums
ops = [b'b, σ(2,2,j)]
J = [b, σ(1,2,i), σ(2,1,i)]
rates = [κ, γ, ν]

eqs = meanfield(ops,H,J;rates=rates,order=2)
nothing #hide
```

```math
\begin{align}
\frac{d}{dt} \langle b^\dagger  b\rangle  =& 1 i \underset{i}{\overset{N}{\sum}} {g}_{i}  \langle b  {\sigma}_{i}^{{21}}\rangle  -1 i \underset{i}{\overset{N}{\sum}} {g}_{i}  \langle b^\dagger  {\sigma}_{i}^{{12}}\rangle  -1.0 \kappa \langle b^\dagger  b\rangle  \\
\frac{d}{dt} \langle {\sigma}_{j}^{{22}}\rangle  =& \nu + 1 i {g}_{j} \langle b^\dagger  {\sigma}_{j}^{{12}}\rangle  -1.0 \gamma \langle {\sigma}_{j}^{{22}}\rangle  -1.0 \nu \langle {\sigma}_{j}^{{22}}\rangle  -1 i {g}_{j} \langle b  {\sigma}_{j}^{{21}}\rangle
\end{align}
```

We can then complete the set of equations by simply calling the **complete** function.

```@example symbolic_sums
eqs_comp = complete(eqs)
nothing #hide
```

### Evaluate and Scale

The equations still contain symbolic summations and indices. Until now, we did not specify a numerical value for the upper boundaries of the summations, meaning the used **N** still has no numerical assignment. There are now two different cases to create the set of equations with a specific number of elements. We can either construct all equations for **N** individual atoms with the function [`evaluate`](@ref) or we assume that all particles behave identical and create the equations with the function [`scale`](@ref). The latter uses the symmetry properties of identical particles, which can substantially reduce the number of equations.

In this example we use **evaluate** for $N=3$ atoms. We can specify the numerical value of $N$ to 3 within the kwarg `limits`.


```@example symbolic_sums
evaled = evaluate(eqs_comp;limits=(N=>3))
nothing #hide
```

The last set of equations is now in a form, which can be convert to an `System` as defined in [ModelingToolkit](https://github.com/SciML/ModelingToolkit.jl) and be solved numerically with [OrdinaryDiffEq](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/OrdinaryDiffEq.jl). Furthermore we give each atom a different coupling strength `g`. This can now be done by using the [`value_map`](@ref) function to create a parameter mapping for the `ODEProblem`. In this case we give as coupling strength a vector with three different values.


```@example symbolic_sums
# Generate an System
using ModelingToolkit
@named sys = System(evaled)

# Solve the system using the OrdinaryDiffEq package
using OrdinaryDiffEq
u0 = zeros(ComplexF64,length(evaled))
p = [Δ, gi, γ, κ, ν]
p0 = [0,[0.75,1.2,1.5],0.25,1,1.5]
p_ = value_map(p,p0;limits=(N=>3))
prob = ODEProblem(sys,u0,(0.0,10.0),p_)
sol = solve(prob,RK4())
nothing #hide
```

Just as with variables in [ModelingToolkit](https://github.com/SciML/ModelingToolkit.jl), the solution of the respective averages can be accessed with a `getindex` method. In the following we extract and plot the photon number and the atomic excited state population of each atom by indexing the solution:


```@example symbolic_sums
using Plots
n = real.(sol[b'*b])
pe = [real.(sol[σ(2,2,i)]) for i = 1:3]
pl = plot(sol.t, n, label="Photon number", xlabel="t")
for i = 1:3
    plot!(sol.t, pe[i], label="Excited state population of atom $(i)")
end
pl # hide
```
